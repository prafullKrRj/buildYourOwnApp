- **:admin**: Contains admin-specific features and interfaces  
- **:common**: Shared models, utilities, and core logic  
- **:customer**: Customer-facing screens and features  

### How to use

- **Async Operations**: Kotlin Coroutines with Flow  
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin  
- **Navigation**: Jetpack Navigation Compose  

### Core Models

The application is built around five main data models:

1. **Development**: Real estate development projects

3. **PropertyUnit**: Individual units available for purchase  
4. **Deal**: Sales transactions with customers  
5. **Payment**: Financial transactions related to deals
