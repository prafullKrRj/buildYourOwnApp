## üõ†Ô∏è How It's Built

### Architecture

Property CRM follows a multi-module architecture with clean separation of concerns:

- **:app**: Main application module that connects all components
- **:admin**: Contains admin-specific features and interfaces
- **:common**: Shared models, utilities, and core logic
- **:customer**: Customer-facing screens and features

### Tech Stack

- **Language**: 100% Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Clean Architecture
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
- **Async Operations**: Kotlin Coroutines with Flow
- **Dependency Injection**: Koin
- **Navigation**: Jetpack Navigation Compose

### Core Models

The application is built around five main data models:

1. **Development**: Real estate development projects
2. **Building**: Structures within developments
3. **PropertyUnit**: Individual units available for purchase
4. **Deal**: Sales transactions with customers
5. **Payment**: Financial transactions related to deals
